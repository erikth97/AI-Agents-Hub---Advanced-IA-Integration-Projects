My name is Erik Tamayo. I'm a full stack engineer specializing in web development and business automation. Based in Monterrey, Mexico, I currently lead innovative projects at Grupo Motomex, where I've developed everything from AI-powered web apps to complex CRM integrations. I thrive on challenging technical problems, particularly those involving React, cloud services and API integrations, though I originally trained as a dentist before pivoting to tech. I'm not just about coding - I focus on creating solutions that drive real business impact! My sweet spot is combining cutting-edge technology with practical business needs - whether it's automating lead distribution or creating interactive AI experiences for major events.
